Name Check Coding Challenge

TechCorp is a medium sized company with legacy front end built in React. As of October 2018, the React team introduced React Hooks as an option to transition away from traditional Class Components. While function based components using Hooks can work side by side with Class Components, TechCorp would like to begin rewriting their legacy code using React Hooks exclusively. 

Your task is to reproduce the functionality built out in `ClassComponent.js` using React Hooks.

Guidelines:

1. Your new component must be written in the `HookComponent.js` file provided for you. Do not create any additional files.

2. All functionality of the original app must be replicated perfectly, including styling (provided for you). Run the app locally to see how everything works

3. Class components and their related lifecycle methods may not be used. 

4. Do not spend more than 4 hours on this challenge.

Notes:

This challenge is designed to assess your ability to read and review other people's code as well as implement new technology. You will have to figure out how the app works using only the legacy code provided. Run the app locally first to see what your goal is.

Information on Hooks can be found at https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-overview.html. The docs contain all of the resources you need to complete this challenge.

Testing & Submission:

This app can be run locally by running `npm install` and using the `npm start` command.
There should be no additional commands necessary for our team to run the app locally. When you are finished. Zip the file and reply all to the sender.
